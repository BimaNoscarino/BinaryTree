# Tree Structures

This repository includes a variety of tree structures written in Java. Details are provided below


## Binary Tree

A sample Binary Search Tree (BST) is included at src/BST.java. It contains an implmentation of a generic class for a BST. There is also a test file located at src/TestBST.java to demonstrate the use of the class.

## AVL Tree

A generic implementation of an AVL Tree is included at src/AVLTree.java. The AVL tree extends from the BST class.

## Huffman Tree

A non-generic implementation of a Huffman Tree is included at src/HuffmanCode.java. Compiling the code and running it will provide an interface to test the tree.
